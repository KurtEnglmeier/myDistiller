Self-Service Information Extraction
myDistiller is a simple tool for information extraction. It’s free and 100% yours. It has no hidden extraction logic. myDistiller operates exclusively on your instructions.
You know how the information looks like you are looking for. What’s left is a tool that enables you to write blueprints of exactly this information. That’s the point where myDistiller comes into play. You write blueprints, or generic patterns the requested data follow, and let myDistiller scan your data collection and extract the data that match the patterns.
myDistiller brings to you the power of Regular Expressions without urging you to write Regular Expressions. Instead you write your extraction statements using a simple language that you will find almost intuitive. myDistiller extracts data from text files in accordance with your statements. However, Regular Expressions are not limited to text files and so does myDistiller.
myDistiller is a desktop application running exclusively on your computer.
